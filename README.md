# AVL-Tree

This program implements an AVL tree that contains information in the format of string. 
The basic implemented functions are add(), which add a new node in the tree, remove(), which 
removes an existing node from the tree, preorder(), which prints the nodes of the tree in preorder,
and isBalanced(), which checks if the current node is balanced. Some additional functions have been 
implemented that refer to the information of the current node, regarding its parent, height, etc.
